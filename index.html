            <h2>Hideo Kojima</h2>
            <div><img src="./img/HK.avif"></div>
            <p>Hideo Kojima is one of the most important figures in the video game industry. His name sits side by side
                with the likes of Shigeru Miyamoto and Hironobu Sakaguchi. Throughout his more than thirty years in the
                industry, the auteur game designer has had a hand in over fifteen projects, most of which were critical
                darlings, if not commercially successful.

                The following list will present the ten best games he worked on, from the world renowned hits to more
                obscure hidden gems. While most people only know Metal Gear, it’s definitely worth checking out some of
                the other titles he made outside of the legendary franchise.

            <h2>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</h2>
            <div><img src="./img/Metal-Gear-Solid-The-Phantom-Pain-Kojima-Productions.avif"></div>
            <p>This 2015 title took Peace Walker’s design and brought it to consoles. While in the field, players
                recruited soldiers and took supplies to further develop their base and manufacture better items and
                weapons. On top of that, it had an incredibly dark story, even by Metal Gear standards.

                The one thing holding it back and preventing it from landing any higher is the drama surrounding it
                which ultimately saw the game releasing in an unfinished state. As unfortunate as this is, at least
                Kojima marched on with his head held high and is gearing up to release Death Stranding this November.

            <h2>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</h2>
            <div><img src="./img/Ocelot-Snake-Eater-Boss-Fight.avif"></div>
            <p>Every Metal Gear game makes drastic changes to the formula, but no one could have foreseen the series
                going from slightly futuristic sterile military environments to a Russian jungle in 1964. Many were
                taken aback by this change, but the move paid off in spades as the prequel proved a worthy successor to
                Metal Gear Solid 2. Environments were more open, leading to newer game play possibilities, and the story
                largely ignored the future entries (though they would later all be connected by Metal Gear Solid 4). In
                addition, a stamina bar and the possibility of injuries made the game more about surviving than simply
                sneaking around.

            <h2>P.T.</h2>
            <div><img src="./img/Norman-Reedus-glad-Silent-Hills-P.T.-cancelled.avif"></div>
            <p>P.T. remains one of the most important games of the decade for several reasons. Firstly, it has forever
                been delisted, existing only on the PS4s of those who downloaded the game before it was eliminated from
                the PSN store. Secondly, it was a shocking way to announce Silent Hills. While the game was sadly
                canceled, P.T.'s impact immediately cemented its place in pop culture. What makes the "game that never
                was" harder to bear was the collaboration between Kojima and famed director Guillermo del Toro.

            <h2>Metal Gear Solid</h2>
            <div><img src="./img/Metal-Gear-Solid-Cover-Tank.avif"></div>
            <p>The series’ first 3D outing made it a force to be reckoned with. The fully voice acted cutscenes were a
                rarity at the time, and the story established characters and laid the foundation for the rest of the
                series.

                It lacks innovations like first-person aiming, rolling, and peaking around corners, but that doesn’t
                hold it back from being being just as enjoyable today as it was twenty years ago. Several moments went
                down in history as iconic scenes in gaming, not the least of which was Psycho Mantis reading the PS1’s
                memory card.

            <h2>Death Stranding (2019)</h2>
            <div><img src="./img/Death-Stranding-Directors-Cut-PC-Leak.avif"></div>
            <p>Death Stranding is Kojima's first game after departing from Konami. There was a lot of hype surrounding
                the game, especially since it also involved Kojima's previous collaborator del Toro. Moreover, the game
                also featured a powerhouse cast that included Norman Reedus, Mad Mikkelsen, and Léa Seydoux, as well as
                other surprising celebrity cameos.

                The game was well-received for its soundtrack, expansive world, and distinct concept. Players loved how
                Death Stranding offered a meaningful gaming experience. Nonetheless, there were still plenty of negative
                but fair reviews of the game that criticized its bloated narrative and drab missions.
